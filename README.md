# Raytracer

The Ray Tracer was an optional exercise in the Functional Programming course ID1019 at KTH. It's mostly the same code our professor used in the seminar. Though I tried to implement most of it myself. [Here's the link to the professor's ray tracer in Elixir, if you want to see the original](https://github.com/ID1019/functional-programming/tree/master/exercises/tracer/src)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `raytracer` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:raytracer, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/raytracer>.
